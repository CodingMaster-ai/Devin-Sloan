Welcome to my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my work in graphic design and user interface (UI/UX) design. This site also highlights the knowledge I've acquired during my time at Orange Technical College - South Campus and through Codecademy.

The website is primarily built using HTML and CSS, with a touch of JavaScript to power the interactive, responsive navigation bar. I developed the entire site using Visual Studio Code.

Upon landing on the homepage, you'll find a brief introduction about me, along with options to explore my graphic design or UI/UX design portfolios. The navigation bar includes quick links to my contact section--where you'll find my contact details--and a resume tab for easy access to my resume.

Both the homepage and contact page include links to get in touch with me, as well as access to selected source code from my UI projects.
